Matrices with 3 dimensions are represented as planes, higher dimensions as hyper-planes and their grand daddy are tensors, used for computational graphs and deep-learning. Tensors are the first-class-citizens of the most popular deep-learning frameworks like TensorFlow and Pytorch. Infact TensorFlow and the Apache Spark SystemML are some sort of low-level linear algebra execution environment."

And think of TensorFlow as one of the most widely used deep learning frameworks, which at its core, is a linear algebra library supporting automatic differentiation. And although TensorFlow’s Python-driven syntax is relatively complex, the Keras library provides an abstraction layer on top of TensorFlow.\n",

The popular **`L1-norm`** is nothing more than computing the **manhattan-distance** between two data points. While **`L2-norm`** is nothing more than computing the **Euclidean-Distance** between two data points and then normalising data points based on these computed distances. We shall see how to code these in Chapter One."
